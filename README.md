# üîê Caesar Cipher Project

A simple Python project that performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher technique. The user can choose to encode or decode any message with a shift value.

---

## üìú Description

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This project allows the user to:
- Encrypt (encode) messages
- Decrypt (decode) messages
- Enter a custom shift value
- Keep using the program until they choose to exit

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to choose whether they want to encode or decode a message.
2. They enter their message (text) and a shift number.
3. The program outputs the result based on the Caesar Cipher logic.
4. The user can repeat the process or exit.

## üß† Caesar Cipher Logic

- Each letter is shifted forward (for encoding) or backward (for decoding) in the alphabet.
- Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces or punctuation) remain unchanged.
- The alphabet is treated as circular (e.g., 'z' shifted by 1 becomes 'a').

type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt: 
encode
enter message: 
hello
enter shift number: 
5
here is encoded result: mjqqt
enter 'yes' if u want to go again. or else type 'no'. 

</pre>
